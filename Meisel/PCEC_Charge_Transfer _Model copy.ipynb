    "# Proton Conducting Ceramic Electrolysis Cell (PCEC) Model Development to Study the effects of Electrolyte thickness on Ohmic Resistance and Faradaic efficiency.\n",
    "This model consists of 3 layers of a PCEC:\n",
    " - A porous cermet negative electrode (Negatrode) of Ni and BCZYYb4411\n",
    " - A solid electrolyte consisting of BCZYYB4411\n",
    " - A porous BCFZY positive electrode (positrode)\n",
    " \n",
    "The solid portion of the anode is 60% NiO and 40% BCZYYb by mass. The mol fractions are: 14% BCZYYb and 86% Ni (the mol frac does not change after the Ni reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The electrolyte will vary from 5-25 microns in thickness\n",
    "\n",
    "The electrolysis reaction that I will be modeling is: $H_\\mathrm{2 (Neg,Gas)} + \\frac{1}{2}O_\\mathrm{2 (Pos,Gas)} \\Longleftrightarrow H_2O_\\mathrm{(Pos,Gas)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation will run at a constant temperature of 550$^\\circ$C with a constant flow of reactants and products of 100 SCCM each. For now I will assume that the gasses flow in at 550$^\\circ$C\n",
    " - Negatrode Side: 5% $H_2$, 95%$N_2$\n",
    " - Positive Side: 10% Steam, 19% $O_2$, and 71S% $N_2$.\n",
    "A bias of -2V will applied to the cell to provide the driving force for the chemical reactions happening in reverse (aginst thermodynamics)\n",
    "\n",
    "# For now, I will just derive and code in my charge transfer equations:"
